### CDP Project Documentation 

This repo hosts the code for the [cdp-docs.github.io/doc](cdp-docs.github.io/doc) site, and is intended to be 
the documentation center for the CDP Project. The site is based on the [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), framework which is an open source project developed in house at Facebook. [cdp-docs.github.io/doc](cdp-docs.github.io/doc), is deployed to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and is publically accessible. 

The team is currently evaluating the viablitly of the product, in the hopes of landing on a solution that will allow building a robust workflow around documentation and communication, while leveraging git as a source of truth.
