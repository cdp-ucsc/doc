# Workflow Lifecycle

Using [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects) to plan and manage the work efforts associated with the CDP will support an agile workflow, improve collaboration, and provide transparency to the process.

### Key Principles

- A single central [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/cdp-ucsc/projects/5) will collect all the issues, ideas, bugs, etc.
- Project views will be used to focus and prioritize the work and planning. 
- All code changes should be accompanied by a [GitHub Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues)
- All changes to the main branch(s) require a pull request and approval by the appropriate reviewers
- Project team members are encouraged to submit Issues, ideas, bugs, etc.

#### Agile Methodology
[Agile project management](https://business.adobe.com/blog/basics/agile) is an incremental and non-linear approach to [project management](https://www.workfront.com/project-management). It focuses on breaking down large projects into manageable tasks, completed in short iterations throughout the [project life cycle](https://www.workfront.com/project-management/life-cycle). 

#### Iterations
Iterations are the planning mechanisms that support the agile methodology; they will allow for breaking down the project into realistic work packages and moving the effort forward one iteration at a time.

### Simple Branching Strategy 

In the diagram below, the circles represent commits to a branch; notice multiple features are being worked on simultaneously.
