# Training Opportunities

Accomplishing the mission of the CDP will require building strong, high-performing collaborative teams, which will require investing in our community to develop the necessary skills. Therefore, the Program team has partnered with [Co:Rise](https://corise.com/), an online training startup with a unique, practical approach to online learning.  

### Time commitments
The classes typically span four weeks and incorporate a combination of lectures and project assignments. Throughout the course, you will be required to complete weekly projects designed to align with the class objectives. These assignments serve as a means to assess your understanding and application of the course material. To maximize the return on your training investment, it is indeed important to have a clear understanding of the time commitment required for the courses. Here are a few reasons why this is strongly encouraged:


- Effective planning: Understand the time commitment in advance to schedule dedicated study time.
- Realistic expectations: Assess if you can balance the training with other commitments.
- Active engagement: Be mentally prepared and fully present during classes or study sessions.
- Efficient progress: Break down the material, create study plans, and track progress against allocated time.
- Commitment to completion: Recognize the investment made and stay motivated until course completion.
