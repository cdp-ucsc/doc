# GitHub Setup Instructions
GitHub hosts our project repositories (repos). Developers will need access to the project repositories in order to contribute to the project. In addition, we utilize many other features of GitHub and an account will be necessary to access those as well.

### 1. Create GitHub Account

1. If you are a UCSC employee and have been asked to work on the project you will need a **free** github account associated with your UCSC email. **This is a two-step process.** The attributes below represent the recommended approach.  You can sign up for an account at [this link](https://github.com/signup).

Once your account is created you will need to enable **MFA/2FA** authentication prior to being added to the UCSC GitHub Organization where you will have access to project documentation, git repositories, and additional project resources.
