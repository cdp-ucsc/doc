# Onboarding Introduction
This document intends to provide a high-level overview of the onboarding process for data practitioners.  While the [Roles and Responsibilities documentation](/doc/docs/program_overview/roles_and_responsibilites) does provide broad categories for data professionals, the onboarding process is nearly identical regardless of whether you are an analyst or an engineer.

## Tools/Resources
The goal of the onboarding process for all data practitioners is to enable them to interact and contribute to projects in a quick and efficient manner. These individuals should begin with reviewing the following Onboarding documentations:
- [Access Overview](access_overview)
- [Account Request Form](account_request_form) 
  - Consider requesting access for GitHub, dbt-cloud, and Snowflake
  - A GitHub account is needed before requesting GitHub Organization access
- [GitHub Setup](github_setup_instructions)
- [dbt Cloud Setup](dbt_cloud_setup)
- [Snowflake Setup](snowflake_setup)
- [Training Opportunities](training)
