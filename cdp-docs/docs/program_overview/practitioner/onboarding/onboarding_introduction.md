# Onboarding Introduction
The intent of this document is to provides a high-level overview of the onboarding process for developers/analysts. The onboarding experience may be unique to each individual and their role in the CDP. However, the process can be generalized for each of the three roles found in the [Role and Responsibilities documentation](/doc/docs/program_overview/roles_and_responsibilites). 

## Business/Data Analysts
The goal of the onboarding process for Business/Data Analysts is to enable them to interact and contribute to projects in a quick and efficient manner. These individuals should begin with reviewing the following Onboarding documentations:
- [Access Overview](access_overview)
- [Account Request Form](account_request_form) 
  - Consider requesting access for GitHub, dbt-cloud, and Snowflake
  - A GitHub account is needed before requesting GitHub Organization access
- [GitHub Setup](github_setup_instructions)
- [dbt Cloud Setup](dbt_cloud_setup)
- [Snowflake Setup](snowflake_setup)

## Analytics Engineers
The goal of the onboarding process for Analytics Engineers is to provide them access to the tools that will allow them to contribute to managing and building projects with an emphasis on data. These individuals should begin by reviewing the following onboarding documentation:
- [Access Overview](access_overview)
- [Account Request Form](account_request_form) 
  - Consider requesting access for GitHub, dbt-cloud, and Snowflake
  - A GitHub account is needed before requesting GitHub Organization access
- [GitHub Setup](github_setup_instructions)
- [dbt Cloud Setup](dbt_cloud_setup)
- [Snowflake Setup](snowflake_setup)

## Data Engineers
Similar to the Analytics Engineers, the goal of the onboarding process for the Data Engineers is to provide them access to the tools that will allow them to contribute in managing and building projects with an emphasis on infrastructure. These individuals should begin with reviewing the following Onboarding documentations:
- [Access Overview](access_overview)
- [Account Request Form](account_request_form) 
  - Consider requesting access for GitHub, dbt-cloud, and Snowflake
  - A GitHub account is needed before requesting GitHub Organization access
