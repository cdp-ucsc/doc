# Request Access

- Campus VPN
- [dbt Cloud](https://cloud.ucsc.getdbt.com/enterprise-login/ucsc/)
- [Fivetran](https://login.ucsc.edu/idp/profile/SAML2/Unsolicited/SSO?providerId=Fivetran)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/cdp-ucsc)
- [Infoview](https://datamgmt.ucsc.edu/launch-infoview.html)
- [Snowflake](https://app.snowflake.com/us-west-2/zna67203)



Note, the campus VPN must be active and each tool must be accessed through the UC Santa Cruz's specific login page. The hyperlinks above will take you to the pages.
