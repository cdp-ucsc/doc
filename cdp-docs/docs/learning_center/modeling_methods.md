# Data Modeling

Below are several of the more established methodologies for data modeling. 

### Kimball Methodology

The Kimball lifecycle is a methodology for developing data warehouses, and has been developed by Ralph Kimball and a variety of colleagues. The methodology "covers a sequence of high level tasks for the effective design, development and deployment" of a data warehouse or business intelligence system. [The Kimball lifecycle - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kimball_lifecycle#:~:text=The%20Kimball%20lifecycle%20is%20a,warehouse%20or%20business%20intelligence%20system)

### Third Normal Form
Third normal form (3NF) is a database schema design approach for relational databases which uses normalizing principles to reduce the duplication of data, avoid data anomalies, ensure referential integrity, and simplify data management. It was defined in 1971 by Edgar F. Codd, an English computer scientist who invented the relational model for database management.

### Data Vault 
Data vault modeling, also known as common foundational warehouse architecture or common foundational modeling architecture, is a database modeling method that is designed to provide long-term historical storage of data coming in from multiple operational systems. It is also a method of looking at historical data that deals with issues such as auditing, tracing of data, loading speed and resilience to change as well as emphasizing the need to trace where all the data in the database came from.

### Inmon Method
The Inmon Method. Bill Inmon, the father of data warehousing, came up with the concept to develop a data warehouse which identifies the main subject areas and entities the enterprise works with, such as customers, product, vendor, and so on.
