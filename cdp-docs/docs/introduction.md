# Introduction
The Common Data Platform is a strategic effort sponsored by campus leadership that will ensure the campus’ data assets support the mission and vision of the University. 
The Common Data Platform will transform the information experience, empower business units, and provide stewardship over shared campus resources to support student and employee success.

## Strategic Objectives

### Centralize and Secure Enterprise Data

Implement secure automated data pipelines from source to target in near real time. Identify, classify and manage access to sensitive data through efficient governance processes.

### Enterprise Data Model (EDW)

The Enterprise Data Model, or EDW, will support integrating and blending data at scale from multiple domains. Information will be collaboratively and transparently curated from raw source data to trusted information available for reporting, analytics, and sharing.

### Data Stewardship & Governance Program

Develop and implement a comprehensive data stewardship and governance program that will promote a thorough understanding of the data, resulting in accurate, conformed data definitions and standardized data elements ready for sharing across the university’s information systems.

### Information Experience Improvements

Bring actionable insights and visualization to the decision makers through modern Business Intelligence tools. Develop career paths for aspiring data professionals in engineering and analytics roles. 

## Benefits of the Common Data Platform

### Security Benefits 

- Data security is a foundational component of the Common Data Platform. 
- Data security, compliance and mitigation are critical to the success of the Common Data Platform and will be incorporated into the design from the onset. 
- Identifying, isolating, and securing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is a foundational design principle of the Common Data Platform.

### Enterprise Data Model Benefits 

- The enterprise data model is a foundational component for the success of the Common Data Platform. 
- The enterprise data model joins data from multiple domains into a single source of trusted facts, thus enabling the campus to become a more nimble, data-driven organization.
- It supports the efforts of the stewardship and governance teams by removing redundancies and conforming data to meet standardization directives.
